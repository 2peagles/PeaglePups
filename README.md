Today's task at hand was to learn slideshows!
    I tried to do the slideshow with just javascript but i got realy confused.I found the react-slideshow which really simplifies everything in an easier manner and can be expanded at ease.
I decided to use Bootstrap's slideshow instead using the src instead of the url that came with react-slideshow.
    Grids on bootstrap make sense now ; ) 12 cols
